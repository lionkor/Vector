# Vector2

Vector2 is a templated header-only 2-dimensional vector class with all common vector operations and some useful additional methods.

## Overview

This is a templated header-only class for a 2D Vector, written in C++17.

## Features

* Header-only & MIT licensed.

* All common operators are implemented and templated ones are used, for math with non-primitive types.

* Consistent naming and documentation.

* Many useful typedefs with consistent naming, like `Vector2f` and `Vector2i`.

* Written for speed and ease-of-use.

* Many useful methods like rotation, reflection and interpolation.

### Progress

- [x] Common operators
- [x] Templated operators
- [x] License (MIT)
- [ ] Full in-source documentation
- [x] Common operations like normalizing, dot/cross/scalar product, distance, magnitude, etc.
- [x] _Extra fancy_ operations like linear interpolation, abs, rotation, reflection

## Notes

- There was no attention paid to threading, so you will have to implement that yourself
