# Vector2

*Note: This project is in active development and is **not done yet**.*

### Development Progress

- [x] Common operators
- [x] Templated operators
- [x] License (MIT)
- [ ] Full in-source documentation
- [x] Common operations like normalizing, dot/cross/scalar product, distance, magnitude, etc.
- [ ] Extra fancy opeations like ~~linear interpolation~~, ~~abs~~, rotation, ~~reflection~~

## Overview

This is a templated header-only class for a 2D Vector, written in C++17.

## Features

* Header-only & MIT licensed.

* All common operators are implemented and I included templated ones, potentially useful for math with non-primitive types.

* Consistent naming and documentation.

* Many useful typedefs with consistent naming, like `Vector2f` and `Vector2i`.

* Written for speed.
