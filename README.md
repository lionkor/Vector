# Vector2

*Note: This project is in active development and is **not done yet**.*

### Development Progress

- [x] Common operators
- [x] Templated operators
- [x] License
- [ ] Full in-source documentation
- [x] Common operations like normalizing, dot/cross/scalar product, distance, magnitude, etc.
- [ ] Extra fancy opeations like linear interpolation, abs, rotation, reflection

## Overview

This is a C++ header-only class for a 2D Vector that uses templates to be usable with many types, including .
It is written to work with the C++17 standard.

## Features

* Header-only & MIT licensed

* All common operators implemented, including templated ones, potentially useful for math with non-primitive types

* Consistent naming and documentation

* Many useful typedefs with consistent naming
